# Destini

## Outline

This app makes me learn more about control flow and think about state of the app.

## What is Destini

Destini is a “choose your own adventure” app. The app will tell a story depending on what the user chooses and can be fleshed out and modified to provide an engaging story-telling experience. 

## What I've learnt

* Conditional statements - If/Else
* Controlling flow
* Functions with outputs
* Using View Tag
* TextView Label value and Button Title value dinamisation
